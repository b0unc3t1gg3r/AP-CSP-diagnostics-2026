The first thing I did when I opened this repository was read the instructions carefully, to make sure I am doing the work correctly.
The most confusing moment was when I first opend this repository, I was pretty confused since it was my first time using Github.
I am new to this website, so I found some of the parts confusing since I had no idea what to do.
When I got stuck what I did was look other student's to see what they did.
I also searched the internet for information about Github for the parts I didn't know what to do.
To decide what information to read or skip, I thoug to myself what I need to do with this information and how does it help me complete my tasks.
I think I am more confident in using Github now, and I think I could use this website pretty well.
One thing I am still unclear about is how to edit files.
