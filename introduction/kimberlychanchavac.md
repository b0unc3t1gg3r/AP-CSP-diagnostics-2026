My name is Kimberly Chanchavac.

I'm interested in AP Computer Science Principles because I believe this course will help me develop not only skills in coding or 
computing, but also skills in logical thinking, problem solving, critical thinking, perseverance, and so many more. These are essential 
skills that will help me in school, my career, and life. Apart from its benefits, computer science is also a field that interests me as
someone who genuinely likes math and using this sort of logic. I also believe that I will pursue a study within computer science, or at 
least something adjacent to it. This makes this class a necessary step toward my future goals and aspirations. Staying with this 
futuristic perspective, computer science is becoming more and more integrated into our daily lives, and this trend is sure to continue 
as technology continues to advance. Because of this, having some sort of understanding of how the technology that surrounds us works is
a key skill in navigating our modern world. All of this has motivated me to join this class and do this diagnostic.

One thing I'm curious about relating to computing or technology is how computers or devices like phones are able to do such complex 
things but are still compact. From my limited understanding, a lot of it comes down to simple numbers or binary, but to turn these 
numbers into a machine where I can type, watch videos, take photos, etc. seems almost impossible without having to make a huge, 
elaborate physical system. Being able to fit something like this in my pocket is something I'm curious to understand, and especially 
how humans came to discover/create this.
