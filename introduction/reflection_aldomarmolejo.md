What was the first thing you did when you opened this repository?
What was the most confusing moment?
What strategies did you use when you got stuck?
How did you decide what information to read or skip?
What do you feel more confident about now?
What still feels unclear?

The first thing I did when I opened this repository was read the insturctions and try to understand the work that had to be done because to be honest I did not understand what to do.
The most condusing moment for me during this process was copying the repository so I can edit it, because I didn't know how to and I was confused by all the buttons on this website.
A strategy I used most was using google to help me mostly with how to create a fork so that I can edit the files and type in them.
