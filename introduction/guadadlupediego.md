My name is Guadalupe Diego

I'm interested in AP Comutper Science Principles because I want to understand how techlongly works beyond just searching somthing up. I spent a lot of time playing games like Project SEKAI COLORFUL STAGE!, Disney Twisted-Wonderland, and Five Nights at Freddy's, they have made me wonder about what goes behind the sences. I just don't want to play the games, I want to understand how they are created and maybe one day make my own. For exmaple, in rythmn games like Project Sekai, I'm curious about how the notes are perfectly timed when someone taps it. It makes me wonder how the developers code timing systems, so that when someone taps the note it would register the note. In Twisted Wonderland, I'm interested in how the interactive stories are programmed and how a player's choices can affect the dialogue or events that happended. And in Five Nights at Freddy’s, it's really interesting how the animatronics can appear anywhere at any time. I want to learn how artificial intelligence is coded to make every character behave differently each time you play.

One thing I'm curious about is how the graphics, sound effects, and animations are designed to combine into one program. How do the programmers organize lines of code, so that everthing works together without crashing? Or how do they test the game to fix bugs? I'd like to learn how the algorithms, data, and problem solving all connect to make technology function.
